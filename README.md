# Rajasthan-Hackathon-4.0-E-mitra

PROBLEM STATEMENT : SCRUTINISING THE DELAY IN THE SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH E-MITRA

-> The task of scutinising and analysing the services provided to the customer through e-mitra is done by "E-Feedback".
-> This feature is only for authorities and officials.
-> We are assuming that the most basic data in the database of a particular service will be userid,name,date_of_apply,date_of_issue,district,contact.
-> We are using date_of_apply and date_of_issue for analysing the particular service.
-> We have taken two services ration card and bhamashah card as a demo.
-> The average delay(in no. of days) has been calculated using datediff() function.
-> The delay as compared to the specified duration provided by the government is often high.
-> We are analysing this through bar graph for different services and for different districts.
-> Further we are also comparing the delay of different districts individually.
-> For a particular service,and for a particular district year-wise average delay is represented through bar graph.
-> For a particular service,the average delay of different districts is represented through bar graph.
->Further we can analyze our system at different substages.
-> For eg: for issuing a ration card, the application has to be processed through five different stages.The delay for each sub-stage can be rectified.

ADVANTAGES-
->Data in the form of bar graphs can be analyzed easily.
->Scutinisation helps in preventing delays.
->Brings more transparency in the system.
->Saves time of applicants.
->Better access to information and quality services for citizens without delay.
->Feature is applicable to all other sectors.
